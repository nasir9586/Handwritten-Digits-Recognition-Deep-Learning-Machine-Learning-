##MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification
This project demonstrates the classification of handwritten digits (0–9) from the MNIST dataset using various machine learning models. It explores preprocessing techniques, builds models, and compares their performances to gain insights into their effectiveness.

##Project Overview
The MNIST dataset is a standard benchmark for machine learning and computer vision. This project aims to classify digits using traditional machine learning algorithms and a neural network, evaluating their performance to identify the most efficient approach.

###Key Features:
Data preprocessing and normalization of MNIST images.
Implementation of multiple machine learning models:
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Logistic Regression
Neural Networks (using TensorFlow/Keras)
Performance comparison based on accuracy and computation time.
Visualization of results, including confusion matrices and sample predictions.

##Dataset
The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits:
Training Set: 60,000 images (28x28 pixels each)
Test Set: 10,000 images
Each image is labeled with the corresponding digit (0–9).
