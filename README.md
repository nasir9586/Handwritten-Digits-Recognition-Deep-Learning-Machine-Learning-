# MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the classification of handwritten digits (0–9) from the MNIST dataset using various machine learning models. It explores preprocessing techniques, builds models, and compares their performances to gain insights into their effectiveness.

The MNIST dataset is a standard benchmark for machine learning and computer vision. This project aims to classify digits using traditional machine learning algorithms and a neural network, evaluating their performance to identify the most efficient approach.

### Key Features:
- Data preprocessing and normalization of MNIST images.
- Implementation of multiple machine learning models:
  - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
  - **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
  - **Logistic Regression**
  - **Neural Networks** (using TensorFlow/Keras)
- Performance comparison based on accuracy and computation time.
- Visualization of results, including confusion matrices and sample predictions.

## Dataset
The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits:
- **Training Set:** 60,000 images (28x28 pixels each)
- **Test Set:** 10,000 images
- Each image is labeled with the corresponding digit (0–9).

## Data Preprocessing
- Images are resized and normalized to improve model performance.
- Feature scaling is applied for better convergence in machine learning models.
- Labels are encoded for classification tasks.

## Model Implementation
The project employs various machine learning algorithms to classify digits. Each model has unique strengths and weaknesses:

### Models Used:
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Uses distance-based classification.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** Employs hyperplanes for optimal separation.
- **Logistic Regression:** A simple linear classifier.
- **Neural Networks:** A deep learning-based approach using TensorFlow/Keras.

## Training & Evaluation
- Models are trained using appropriate hyperparameters.
- Performance is evaluated using **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.
- Confusion matrices and classification reports provide insights into model efficiency.

## Results & Insights
- **Neural Networks achieved the highest accuracy of 97.95%**.
- Traditional machine learning models like **SVM and KNN performed well but did not match deep learning accuracy**.
- Visualization of misclassified digits helped identify model weaknesses.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for improved accuracy.
- Optimize models for faster inference.
- Extend deployment to cloud-based APIs for real-time digit recognition.
