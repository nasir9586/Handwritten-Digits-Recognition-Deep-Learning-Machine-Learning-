# Handwritten-Digits-Recognition-Project
This project focuses on classifying handwritten digits (0â€“9) from the MNIST dataset using various machine learning models, including KNN, SVM, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks. The models are trained and evaluated to compare their performance based on accuracy and computational efficiency.
